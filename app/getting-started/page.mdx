## Getting Started

Follow these steps to get your **Next.js 15 Enterprise Starter Kit** up and running.

1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/zahidrahimoon/next-starter.git
cd next-starter
```

2. Install dependencies

```bash
# Using npm
npm install
```

<Callout type="warning">
  ⚠️ If you install any additional packages, make sure they are compatible with **Next.js 15**, **TypeScript**, and your current project setup. Using incompatible packages can break the build or runtime behavior.
</Callout>

2.1 Create an account (if applicable)

After you install dependencies, open the app in the browser and create a developer account (if the starter prompts you to register). Typically this is a local onboarding screen or `login` route — complete the registration, verify your email (if required), and then sign in. Once signed in you should land on the home/dashboard page that contains links to the rest of the app.

For more detail about the repository layout and where to find each feature, see the [Project Structure](/project-structure) page.

3. Run the development server

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to see your application running.

🎯 You are now ready to develop production-ready apps with the **Next.js 15 Enterprise Starter Kit**.
